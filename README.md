# Softwares Used- Python

## Ammortization-table

### Created a python Program which creates an ammortization table.

* Got user to input principal, minimum expected payment, interest, and extra payment, and error check that all input is valid. If not valid, have the user re-enter. 
* Note that one does not need to enter the term of the loan.
* Program computes and prints 
  * The schedule of payments
  * Total (sum of all) payments, interest paid, and principal applied.
  * Total time (in years) required to payoff the loan.

## Roling Window Statistics

### GOOG.csv is a file containing historical stock prices over a one-year period
Created a Python program which:
* From the user, inputs the rolling window size. For instance, inputting 5 would yield a
weekly window, while inputting a 20 is a monthly window, etc. Make sure that the
input is valid. For instance, if a user inputs 400, this would be impossible because not
enough data exists.
Over the rolling window, computed 
  * Range: max - min
  * Mean: average
  * Median: 50th percentile
  * Standard Deviation: standard deviation
